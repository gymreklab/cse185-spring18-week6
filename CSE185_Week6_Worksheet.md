# CSE 185 Lab 6 Worksheet

This worksheet is worth the same amount as a lab report (based on the percent of points scored for each question below scaled to a 10 point scale). 

## Part 1: Mass spectrometry

**What level is the first scan?** (1pt)

**How many peaks are in the first scan?** (1 pt)

**How many scans are in the entire file?** (1 pt)

**In the first spectrum that loaded (spectrum ID 4970), what is the m/z ratio of the most intense peak? (You can see this by hovering your mouse over that peak).** (1pt)

**In the summary tab, compute the summary charts. Then: what are the two most abundant precursor ion charges?** (1pt)

**How many spectra are in our filtered file?** (1pt)

**The top hit is a contaminant! What is it? Give one sentence explanation of why this shows up in our list.** (1 pt)


**List the top 5 scoring protein hits (not contaminants!)** (1 pt)

**How many peptides were found to match the top hit, NUCL_MOUSE (Nucleolin)?** (1pt)


**Briefly investigate the function of the top 3 genes. Are any known to be related to telomere function?** (3pts)

## Part 2: De novo peptide sequencing

**How many peaks are in this file? What is the range of m/z ratios? (i.e. min and max). How does the max ion mass here compare to the precursor ion mass? What is the most abundant m/z ratio?** (4pts)

**Include your table in your worksheet. Explain your answer for at least two more amino acids.** (3 pts - 1 for including table, 2 for explanation of at least 2 more AAs)

**This was pretty tedious! If you were going to write a program to automate this process, how would you do it? (max 2-3 sentences about your idea.** (2 pts)

**What is the op scoring sequence? How close is it to your guess? Note: neither answer is probably completely correct!** (1 pt)

**Hypothesize why some peaks are missing from our spectrum file.** (1 pt)

**Suggest a way we could modify our mass spec experiment to distinguish between amino acids with near identical masses, such as Isoleucine and Leucine.** (1 pt)
