# Week 6: Proteomics (part 1)
Skills covered: 

This week, to give you a small break before we go into final project mode, you won't have to write a lab report. But you will have to go through the lab tutorials and fill in your lab notebook as usual. Instead of writing a report, answer the questions in bold in this tutorial in the "CSE185_Week6_Worksheet.md" file in the Github repository.
